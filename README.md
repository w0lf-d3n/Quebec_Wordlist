A useful wordlist made from French Canadian leaked passwords!

---
## GOAL

At @w0lfd3n, we are a group of ethical hackers from Quebec, Canada. 

This project was born from our desire to create the French Canadian equivalent of the "rockyou" wordlist, to be used with Hashcat, John The Ripper or your favorite tool. 
Also, this wordlist aims to replace "Richelieu", as more focused on Quebecois passwords.   

The final wordlist is a combination of public available repos and leaked passwords related to French Canadian domains ( please see the setion methodology for more infos).

---
## METHODOLOGY


Our wordlist is based on multiple domains coming from Quebec private sector, public institutions, telecoms and more. 

By enumerating relevant domains and passwords, while eliminating duplicates, we obtained the list quebec.txt.

We plan to regurarly update the wordlist, as we find more proper data to add (contact us if you like to add your findings).
